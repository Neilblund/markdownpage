<h2>Forms of analysis</h2>
<p>Your paper/presentation should be primarily descriptive, but you should leave some space for prediction or explanation as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="forms-of-analysis-2" class="slide level2">
<h2>Forms of analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Answering “why” is often far more complicated than “what happened?”</li>
<li>Conceptual ambiguity: concepts like claims, success, repression, demobilization etc. are not straightforward</li>
<li>Confounding: spurious correlations are common, because contentious political actors are strategic actors in an interdependent system</li>
<li>No true counterfactuals: causation is never really observed</li>

<li>What do participants do?
